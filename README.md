# Mixed Reality Schizophrenia Simulation

### A Unity-based MR experience that simulates schizophrenia symptoms using immersive mixed reality technologies.

## Overview
This project aims to **simulate the experience of schizophrenia** by leveraging **Mixed Reality (MR)** to create visual and auditory hallucinations. The goal is to **enhance empathy and understanding** of the condition by allowing users to experience its symptoms in a controlled environment.

## Features
**Realistic Visual Hallucinations** – Dynamic visual distortions, shadow figures, and altered perception.  
**Auditory Hallucinations** – Spatialized whispering, voices, and internal monologues using 3D audio.  
**Support for AR/MR Devices** – Works primarily with Meta Quest and other XR-supported devices.  

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity (URP or HDRP for enhanced visuals)
- **XR SDKs:** MRTK (Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit) / OpenXR
- **Rendering Pipeline:** URP / HDRP
- **Version Control:** GitHub
